The cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn't in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates disappear.
Whenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can't see or if it relies on senses other than sight.
A duplicate has the cloaker's AC and uses its saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.

In a new form, the couatl retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and other actions are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks.

While attached to the target, the darkmantle can attack no other creature except the target but has advantage on its attack rolls. The darkmantle's speed also becomes 0, it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed, and it moves with the target.
A creature can detach the darkmantle by making a successful DC 13 Strength check as an action. On its turn, the darkmantle can detach itself from the target by using 5 feet of movement.
A 15-foot radius of magical darkness extends out from the darkmantle, moves with it, and spreads around corners. The darkness lasts as long as the darkmantle maintains concentration, up to 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a spell). Darkvision can't penetrate this darkness, and no natural light can illuminate it. If any of the darkness overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the light is dispelled.

The deva magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating equal to or less than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the deva's choice).
In a new form, the deva retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and special senses are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks.

The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni maintains concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be restrained by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.
A creature can use its action to free a creature restrained by the whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check. If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer restrained and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind.

The dryad targets one humanoid or beast that she can see within 30 feet of her. If the target can see the dryad, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed. The charmed creature regards the dryad as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the dryad's control, it takes the dryad's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can.
Each time the dryad or its allies do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the dryad dies, is on a different plane of existence from the target, or ends the effect as a bonus action. If a target's saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the dryad's Fey Charm for the next 24 hours.
The dryad can have no more than one humanoid and up to three beasts charmed at a time.

The harpy must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is incapacitated.
While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is more than 5 ft. away from the harpy, the must move on its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route.

The algorith can summon forth a tiny rune of law and throw it as a weapon. Any creature within 30 feet of the square where the reality bomb lands takes 21 (6d6) force damage and is stunned until the start of the algorith's next turn.

If the bite and constrict attacks hit the same target in one turn, the creature is swallowed whole. The target is blinded and restrained, and has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the andrenjinyi. The target takes no damage inside the andrenjinyi. The andrenjinyi can have three Medium-sized creatures or four Small-sized creatures swallowed at a time. If the andrenjinyi takes 20 damage or more in a single turn from a swallowed creature, the andrenjinyi must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 5 feet of the andrenjinyi. If the andrenjinyi is slain, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the andrenjinyi by using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone. The andrenjinyi can regurgitate swallowed creatures as a free action.
When a creature is swallowed by an andrenjinyi, it must make a successful DC 19 Wisdom saving throw each round at the end of its turn or be affected by true polymorph into a new form chosen by the andrenjinyi. The effect is permanent until dispelled or ended with a wish or comparable magic.

While grappled this way, the creature is restrained by the angler worm (but not by its snare lines), it can't breathe, and it takes 22 (5d8) acid damage at the start of each of the angler worm's turns. A creature that escapes from the angler worm's coils may need to make an immediate DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being restrained again, if it escapes into a space occupied by more snare lines.
The angler worm selects a spot within 20 feet of itself; that spot glows with a faint, blue light until the start of the worm's next turn. All other creatures that can see the light at the start of their turn must make a successful DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the start of their next turn.

A living creature that is injured by or makes physical contact with a creature carrying the white ghost shivers must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw at the end of the encounter to avoid becoming infected. This disease manifests after 24 hours, beginning as a mild chill, but increasingly severe after a day, accompanied by a fever. Hallucinations are common, and the fright they induce lends the disease its name. At onset, the infected creature gains two levels of exhaustion that cannot be removed until the disease is cured by lesser restoration, comparable magic, or rest. The infected creature makes another DC 11 Constitution saving throw at the end of each long rest; a successful save removes one level of exhaustion. If the saving throw fails, the disease persists. If both levels of exhaustion are removed by successful saving throws, the victim has recovered naturally.

Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) piercing damage, and a Medium or smaller target is grappled (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. If the target is neither undead nor a construct, the cactid drains the target's body fluids; at the start of each of the target's turns, the target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's hit point maximum is reduced by 3 (1d6). If a creature's hit point maximum is reduced to 0 by this effect, the creature dies. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest and drinks abundant water or until it receives a greater restoration spell or comparable magic. The cactid has two tendrils, each of which can grapple one target at a time.
Each creature grappled by the cactid is pulled up to 5 feet straight toward the cactid.
The cambium makes four needle fingers attacks.
Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d10 + 5) piercing damage. In addition, the target must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw; if it fails, the cambium can either inflict Ability Damage or Imbalance Humors. A target makes this saving throw just once per turn, even if struck by more than one needle fingers attack.
When the target of the cambium's needle fingers fails its Constitution saving throw, one of its ability scores (cambium's choice) is reduced by 1d4 until it finishes a long rest. If this reduces a score to 0, the creature is unconscious until it regains at least one point.
When the target of the cambium's needle fingers fails its Constitution saving throw, apply one of the following effects:
The target cannot be healed-naturally or magically-until after their next long rest.
The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to shrug off the flux before the duration ends.

In addition, the target's speed is reduced by half, it can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, but not both. While it is stealing time, the chronalmental's speed increases by 30 feet, and when it takes the multiattack action, it can make an additional slam attack. The targeted creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

The psoglav demon makes three bite attacks.
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d12 + 5).
The psoglav emits a beam from its single eye. One target within 60 feet of the psoglav is hit automatically by the ray. The target is knocked 20 feet back and must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. The target's shadow stays in the space the target was originally in, and acts as an undead shadow under the command of the psoglav demon. If the creature hit with the shadow stealing ray flees the encounter, it is without a natural shadow for 1d12 days before the undead shadow fades and the creature's natural shadow returns. The undead shadow steals the body of its creature of origin if that creature is killed during the encounter; in that case, the creature's alignment shifts to evil and it falls under the command of the psoglav. The original creature regains its natural shadow immediately if the undead shadow is slain. A creature can only have its shadow stolen by the shadow stealing ray once per day, even if hit by the rays of two different psoglav demons, but it can be knocked back by it every time it is hit.

Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds. In addition, the skin bat attaches itself to the target. The skin bat can't bite a different creature while it's attached, and its bite attack automatically hits a creature the skin bat is attached to. Removing a skin bat requires a successful DC 11 Strength check and inflicts 5 (1d4 + 3) slashing damage to the creature the bat is being removed from. A successful save renders the target immune to skin bat poison for 24 hours.
The sight of potential host bodies so excites the fetal savant that it babbles and giggles madly and childishly, creating an insanity effect. All sane creatures that start their turns within 60 feet of the fetal savant must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be affected by confusion (as the spell) for 1d4 rounds. This is a psychic effect. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same fetal savant's babbling for 24 hours. This action cannot be taken when the fetal savant is using Soul Exchange.
As an action, the fetal savant can attempt to take control of a creature it can see within 90 feet, forcing an exchange of souls as a magic jar spell, using its own body as the container. The fetal savant can use this power at will, but it can exchange souls with only one other creature at a time. The victim resists the attack with a successful DC 13 Charisma saving throw. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the same fetal savant's soul exchange for 24 hours. If the saving throw fails, the fetal savant takes control of the target's body and ferociously attacks nearby opponents, eyes blazing with otherworldly light. As an action, the fetal savant can shift from its host body back to its own, if it is within range, returning the victim's soul to its own body. If the host body or fetal savant is brought to 0 hit points within 90 feet of each other, the two souls return to their original bodies and the creature at 0 hit points is dying; it must make death saving throws until it dies, stabilizes, or regains hit points, as usual. If the host body or fetal savant is slain while they are more than 90 feet apart, their souls cannot return to their bodies and they are both slain. While trapped in the fetal savant's withered body, the victim is effectively paralyzed and helpless.

If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies and immediately transforms into a randomly chosen swarm of insects. The curse lasts until removed by the remove curse spell or comparable magic.

Each creature in Ia'Affrat's space must make a DC 18 Strength saving throw. Each creature that fails takes 28 (8d6) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (4d6) fire damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage and is flung up 20 feet away from Ia'Affrat in a random direction and knocked prone. If the saving throw is successful, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn't flung away or knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes an object, such as a wall or floor, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it traveled. If the target collides with another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.
The automata devil makes two melee attacks, using any combination of bite, claw, and whip attacks. The bite attack can be used only once per turn.

An individual target can be grappled by only one whip at a time. A grappled target takes 9 (2d8) piercing damage at the start of its turn.
If a target is already grappled in a whip at the start of the automata devil's turn, both creatures make opposed Strength (Athletics) checks. If the grappled creature wins, it takes 9 (2d8) piercing damage and remains grappled. If the devil wins, the grappled creature is dragged into the devil's stomach maw, a mass of churning gears, razor teeth, and whirling blades. The creature takes 49 (4d20 + 7) slashing damage and is grappled, and the whip is free to attack again on the devil's next turn. The creature takes another 49 (4d20 + 7) slashing damage automatically at the start of each of the automata devil's turns for as long as it remains grappled in the maw. Only one creature can be grappled in the punishing maw at a time. The automata devil can freely "spit out"a creature or corpse during its turn, to free up the maw for another victim.

Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage.
as a bonus action, a gilded devil can turn rings, necklaces, and other jewelry momentarily against their wearer. The devil can affect any visible item of jewelry on up to two creatures within 60 feet, twisting them into cruel barbs and spikes. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw to halve the damage from this effect. If the saving throw fails, the victim takes 13 (3d8) piercing damage and an additional effect based on the item location targeted.

an item is treated as jewelry if it is made of a precious material (such as silver, gold, ivory, or adamantine), adorned with gems, or both, and is worth at least 100 gp.

hand: STR Save or Drop any held item

A gilded devil's attacks ignore any protection provided by nonmagical armor made of bronze, iron, steel, or similar metals. Protection provided by valuable metals such as adamantine, mithral, and gold apply, as do bonuses provided by non-metallic objects.
As a bonus action, a gilded devil wearing jewelry worth at least 1,000 gp can reshape it into a +2 heavy flail. A creature struck by this jeweled flail suffers disadvantage on all Wisdom saving throws until his or her next short rest, in addition to normal weapon damage. The flail reverts to its base components 1 minute after it leaves the devil's grasp, or upon the gilded devil's death.
As an action, a gilded devil can consume nonmagical jewelry or coinage worth up to 1,000 gp. For each 200 gp consumed, it heals 5 hp of damage.

An ink devil can corrupt the magic within any scroll by touch. Any such corrupted scroll requires a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw to use successfully. If the check fails, the scroll's spell affects the caster if it is an offensive spell, or it affects the nearest devil if it is a beneficial spell.
Ink devils can flick ink from their fingertips at a single target within 15 feet of the devil. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 13), or the affected creature gains a devil's mark—a black, red, or purple tattoo in the shape of an archduke's personal seal (most often Mammon or Totivillus but sometimes Arbeyach, Asmodeus, Beelzebub, Dispater, or others). All devils have advantage on spell attacks made against the devil-marked creature, and the creature has disadvantage on saving throws made against spells and abilities used by devils. The mark can be removed only by a remove curse spell or comparable magic. In addition, the mark detects as faintly evil and often shifts its position on the body. Paladins, witchfinders, and some clerics may consider such a mark proof that a creature has made a pact with a devil.
The koralk can make three stinger attacks and two scythe attacks. It can also make a bite attack if it has a target grappled.
Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d12 + 3) slashing damage, OR a Medium-sized or smaller target can be grappled by the koralk's smaller, vestigial arms instead (no damage, escape DC 13).

Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned. While poisoned this way, the target takes 10 (3d6) poison damage at the start of each of its turns, from liquefaction of its innards. A successful save renders the target immune to the koralk's poison for 24 hours. If a creature dies while poisoned by a koralk, its body bursts open, spewing vile liquid and a newly-formed lemure devil. The lemure is under the command of any higher-order devil nearby. The poison can be neutralized by lesser restoration, protection from poison, or comparable magic. If the lemure is killed, the original creature can be restored to life by resurrection or comparable magic.

This reduction to a creature's hit point maximum lasts until it is affected by a lesser restoration spell or comparable magic.

A doppelrat under duress creates clones of itself at the beginning of its turn. Each round for 4 rounds, the number of live doppelrats quadruples but never exceeds 20. For example, when the doppelrat triggers arcane doubling, 1 rat becomes 4; at the start of the rat's next turn, those 4 become 16; and at the start of the rat's third turn, those 16 become 20, the maximum allowed. If one of the duplicates was destroyed between the original doppelrat's 1st and 2nd turns, then the surviving 3 would become 12, and so on. Each duplicate appears in the same space as any other rat, can either move or take an action the round it appears, and has 4 hit points and AC 13. Any surviving duplicates perish 1 minute (10 rounds) after the first ones were created. If the original doppelrat dies, its clones stop duplicating but the preexisting clones remain until their time expires. A creature can identify the original doppelrat from its duplicates as an action by making a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Perception) check.
At the end of a dopplerat encounter, every creature bitten by a doppelrat or its duplicates must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or contract the degenerate cloning disease. During each long rest, the diseased creature grows and sloughs off a stillborn clone. The doppeling process leaves the diseased creature incapacitated for 1 hour, unable to move and barely able to speak (spellcasting is impossible in this state). When the incapacitation wears off, the creature makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw; it recovers from the disease when it makes its second successful save. Humanoid clones created by the disease cannot be brought to life in any manner.

The target must be size Large or smaller to be pulled this way. The dorreq can maintain a grapple on one Large, two Medium, or two Small creatures at one time.
Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of a dorreq must make a successful DC 14 Dexterity saving throw each round or be restrained by the dorreq's tentacles until the start of its next turn. On its turn, the dorreq can ignore or freely release a creature in the affected area.

Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d10 + 2) bludgeoning damage.
A future self of the eonic drifter materializes in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the drifter. The future self has the eonic drifter's stats and its full hit points, and it takes its turn immediately after its present self. Killing the original eonic drifter makes its future self disappear. If the present self sees its future self die, the eonic drifter must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. There is no effect if the save succeeds. If the saving throw fails, roll 1d6 to determine the effect on the eonic drifter: 1 = frightened, 2 = incapacitated, 3 = paralyzed, 4 = unconscious, 5 or 6 = has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. These effects last 1d4 rounds.
The future self makes a time warping staff attack against a target. If the attack hits, instead of causing bludgeoning damage, both the target and the attacker jump forward through time, effectively ceasing to exist in the present time. They reappear in the same locations 1d4 rounds later, at the end of the present self's turn. Creatures occupying those locations at that moment are pushed 5 feet in a direction of their own choosing. The target of the drift (but not the future self) must then make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, with effects identical to those for the eonic drifter witnessing the death of its future self (see Drift Backward). The future self doesn't reappear after using this ability the second time; only the target of the drift reappears from the second use. This does not trigger a saving throw for the present self.

Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8 + 5) piercing damage and a Medium or smaller target is grappled (escape DC 15). A grappled creature takes 13 (2d8 + 3) necrotic damage at the start of the hag's turns, and the hag heals half as many hit points. The hag gains excess healing as temporary hit points. The hag can grapple one or two creatures at a time. Also see Face Peel.
Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (4d6 + 5) slashing damage.
The blood hag targets a living creature within 30 feet that she detects with her blood sense and makes the target bleed uncontrollably. The target must make a successful DC 16 Constitution saving throw or suffer one of the effects listed below. A target that saves successfully cannot be affected by this hag's ability again for 24 hours.
Blood Choke Curse. The target's mouth fills with blood, preventing any speech or spellcasting with verbal components for 1 minute.
Blood Eye. The target's eyes well up with bloody tears. The target is blinded for 1 minute.
Heart Like Thunder. The target hears only the rushing of blood and their thumping heart. They are deaf for 1 minute.
Rupturing Arteries. The victim suffers 7 (2d6) slashing damage as its veins and arteries burst open. The target repeats the saving throw at the beginning of each of its turns. It takes 3 (1d6) necrotic damage if the saving throw fails, but the effect ends on a successful save.
The blood hag peels the face off one grappled foe. The target must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the face is torn off; the target takes 38 (8d6 + 10) slashing damage and is stunned until the start of the hag's next turn. If the save succeeds, the target takes half damage and isn't stunned. Heal, regeneration, or comparable magic restores the stolen features; other curative magic forms a mass of scar tissue. The peeled-off face is a tiny, animated object (per the spell-20 HP, AC 18, no attack, Str 4, Dex 18) under the hag's control. It retains the former owner's memories and personality. Blood hags keep such faces as trophies, but they can also wear someone's face to gain advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks made to imitate the face's former owner.
A mirror hag can use its Reconfiguring Curse and make one melee attack.
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (4d8 + 3) piercing damage, or 39 (8d8 + 3) piercing damage against a stunned target.
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage.
The mirror hag curses a living creature within 60 feet, giving it beastly or hideous features. The target of the reconfiguring curse must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 Charisma damage. A successful save renders the target immune to further uses of that hag's curse for 24 hours.
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (3d8 + 4) slashing damage.
The red hag radiates an aura in a 30-foot radius, lasting for 3 rounds, that draws all fluids out through a creature's mouth, nose, eyes, ears, and pores. Every creature of the hag's choosing that starts its turn in the affected area takes 18 (4d6 + 4) necrotic damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw.
The sand hag makes two claw attacks.
Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must make a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion.
The sand hag generates a blast of hot wind in a 30-foot line or a 15-foot cone. Creatures inside it take 14 (4d6) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage and are blinded for 1 minute; a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw halves the damage and negates the blindness. A blinded creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The affected area (line or cone) is heavily obscured until the end of the sand hag's next turn.
The hag polymorphs into a Small or Medium female humanoid, or back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. She reverts to her true form if she dies.
The owl harpy makes two claw attacks and two talon attacks.
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage.
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.
An owl harpy that hovers in flight can shake a fine, magical dander from her wings over a creature within 20 feet and directly below her. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious and be poisoned for 10 minutes. It wakes up if it takes damage or if a creature uses an action to shake it awake, but waking up doesn't end the poisoning.
The owl harpy sings a magical melody. Every humanoid and giant within 300 feet of the harpy that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. The harpy must use a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy becomes incapacitated. While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies. A charmed target that is more than 5 feet away from the harpy must move at its highest rate (including dashing, if necessary) along the most direct route to get within 5 feet of the harpy. The charmed creature doesn't maneuver to avoid opportunity attacks, but it can repeat the saving throw every time it takes damage from anything other than the harpy. It also repeats the saving throw before entering damaging terrain (lava or a pit, for example), if the most direct route includes a dangerous space. A creature also repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. A successful saving throw ends the effect on that creature and makes the creature immune to this harpy's song for 24 hours.
The haugbui makes two psychic claw attacks.
Ranged Magical Attack: +10 to hit, range 40 ft., one target. Hit: 32 (6d8 + 5) psychic damage.

Hit: 19 (2d12 + 6) slashing damage and the target must make a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled by the herald of blood (escape DC 16). While grappled this way, the creature takes 39 (6d12) acid damage at the start of each of the herald's turns. The herald can have any number of creatures grappled this way.
The herald of darkness uses Majesty of the Abyss, if it is available, and makes one melee attack.
Melee Weapon Attack. +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., all creatures in reach. Hit: 6 (1d12) necrotic damage and targets are paralyzed until the start of the herald's next turn. Making a DC 17 Constitution saving throw negates the paralysis.
The herald of darkness emits a sinister burst of infernal power. All creatures within 30 feet and in direct line of sight of the herald take 19 (3d12) necrotic damage and must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. Those who fail the saving throw are blinded for 2 rounds; those who succeed are frightened for 2 rounds.
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d12 + 5) slashing damage.
The horakh makes two claw attacks and one bite attack.
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (4d8 + 4) slashing damage. If the bite attack hits a target that's grappled by the horakh, the target must make a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or one of its eyes is bitten out. A creature with just one remaining eye has disadvantage on ranged attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. If both (or all) eyes are lost, the target is blinded. The regenerate spell and comparable magic can restore lost eyes. Also see Implant Egg, below.
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (3d8 + 4) piercing damage. If both attacks hit the same Medium or smaller target in a single turn, the target is grappled (escape DC 14).
If a horakh's bite attack reduces a grappled creature to 0 hit points, or it bites a target that's already at 0 hit points, it implants an egg in the creature's eye socket. The deposited egg grows for 2 weeks before hatching. If the implanted victim is still alive, it loses 1d2 Constitution every 24 hours and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. After the first week, the victim is incapacitated and blinded. When the egg hatches after 2 weeks, an immature horakh erupts from the victim's head, causing 1d10 bludgeoning, 1d10 piercing, and 1d10 slashing damage. A lesser restoration spell can kill the egg during its incubation.
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d10 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

The frost maiden makes two ice dagger attacks.
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) cold damage.
The ice maiden adopts the form of a swirling snow cloud. Her stats are identical to an air elemental that deals cold damage instead of bludgeoning.
Ice and snow hinder her opponent's movement, as the entangle spell (DC 17).
An ice maiden may kiss a willing individual, freezing the target's heart. The target falls under the sway of a dominate spell, his or her alignment shifts to LE, and he or she gains immunity to cold. The ice maiden can have up to three such servants at once. The effect can be broken by dispel magic (DC 17), greater restoration, or the kiss of someone who loves the target.
In a snowy environment, the ice maiden attempts to blind all creatures within 30 feet of herself. Those who fail a DC 17 Charisma saving throw are blinded for 1 hour. Targets that are immune to cold damage are also immune to this effect.
The idolic deity uses Seduce the Righteous and makes two slam attacks.
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) psychic damage.
The idolic deity targets one creature it can see within 30 feet. The target has disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, or ability checks (the idolic deity chooses which) until the end of its next turn. A protection from evil and good spell cast on the target prevents this effect, as does a magic circle.
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage, and the target must make a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (2d4) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
The imy-ut ushabti parts its wrappings voluntarily and releases a swarm of scarab beetles that follow its mental commands. The statistics of this swarm are identical to a swarm of insects, but with the following attack instead of a swarm of insects' standard bite attack:
Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (4d4) piercing damage, or 5 (2d4) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer, and the target must make a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (2d4) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A poisoned creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
The isonade makes one tail slap attack and one bite attack.
Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 42 (5d12 + 10) piercing damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 20). If the target was already grappled from a previous bite, it's also swallowed whole (see below).
Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 31 (6d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage.
The isonade leaps out of the water to crash down onto a target with devastating effect. The isonade must move 30 feet in a straight line toward its target before jumping. When jumping, the isonade travels up to 30 feet through the air before landing. Any creature occupying the space where the isonade lands takes 76 (12d10 + 10) bludgeoning damage and becomes submerged 10 feet below the surface of the water. Targets that make a successful DC 20 Strength saving throw take half damage and are not submerged, but are moved to the nearest unoccupied space. Boats and structures are not immune to this attack.
When the isonade's bite attack hits a target grappled from a previous bite attack, the target is also swallowed. The grapple ends, but the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the isonade, and it takes 36 (8d8) acid damage at the start of each of the isonade's turns. An isonade can have two Large, four Medium, or six Small creatures swallowed at a time. If the isonade takes 40 damage or more from a swallowed creature in a single turn, it must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone within 10 feet of the isonade. If the isonade dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone.
The jaculus makes one jaws attack and one claws attack.
Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 2) piercing damage.

The kikimora makes two claw attacks.
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.
When a kikimora chooses a house to inhabit, she scrawls a symbol on a wall, baseboard, cupboard, or semi-permanent object (like a stove) to be her tiny domain. This ability creates a hidden extra-dimensional dwelling. After creating a hidey-hole, a kikimora can teleport herself and up to 50 lb of objects to the designated location instead of making a normal move. This extradimensional space can only be entered by the kikimora or by a creature using a plane shift spell or ability. The location can be determined by casting detect magic in the area of the sigil, but it takes a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check to plane shift into the space. Inside the hidey-hole, a kikimora can see what is going on outside the space through a special sensor. This sensor functions like a window, and it can be blocked by mundane objects placed in front of the sigil. If she leaves an item in her space, it remains there even if she removes the sigil and places it in another location. If someone else removes the sigil, all contents are emptied into the Ethereal Plane (including any beings within her hidey-hole at the time). In this case, the kikimora can attempt a DC 15 Charisma saving throw to instead eject herself (but none of her possessions) into a space adjacent to the sigil.
The kobold makes two attacks.
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage plus 5 (2d4) poison damage.

The kobold throws a flask of volatile substances at a point within 30 feet. The flask explodes in a 15-foot radius. Creatures in the area take 17 (5d6) poison damage and are poisoned for 1 minute, or take half damage and are not poisoned with a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. A poisoned creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the poisoned condition on a success. Instead of poison damage, the kobold can deal the damage type currently in effect for its Apothecary trait.
The kobold makes 2 attacks.
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage and the target must make a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute.

The kobold trapsmith primes and throws a device at a point within 30 feet. The device explodes when it hits something solid, flinging razor-sharp spikes in a 15-foot-radius sphere. Every creature in the area takes 14 (4d6) piercing damage, or half damage with a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. The ground inside the spherical area is littered with spikes; it becomes difficult terrain, and a creature that falls prone in the area takes 7 (2d6) piercing damage.
Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target is restrained (escape DC 13). While restrained, the target takes 7 (2d6) lightning damage at the start of its turn and falls prone. The trapsmith has advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing metal armor. A stunner is a bola made of metal wire, magnets, and static electricity capacitors. A kobold trapsmith can recharge it during a long rest.

The target must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken from this attack, and Koschei regains an equal number of hit points. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
The kot bayun makes one bite attack and one claws attack.

Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d10 + 3) slashing damage.
The kot bayun puts creatures to sleep with its haunting melody. While a kot bayun sings, it can target one hearing creature within a 100-foot radius. This target must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or fall asleep. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Each round the kot bayun maintains its song, it can select a new target. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the effect of that kot bayun's song for 24 hours. The slumbering song even affects elves, but they have advantage on the Charisma saving throw.
The krake spawn makes eight tentacle attacks and one bite attack. It can substitute one constrict attack for two tentacle attacks if it has a creature grappled at the start of the krake spawn's turn, but it never constricts more than once per turn.

The krake spawn emits black, venomous ink in a 30-foot cloud as a bonus action while underwater. The cloud affects vision as the darkness spell, and any creature that starts its turn inside the cloud takes 10 (3d6) poison damage, or half damage with a successful DC 18 Constitution saving throw. The krake spawn's darkvision is not impaired by this cloud. The cloud persists for 1 minute, then disperses.

The leshy makes two club attacks.
The leshy appears to change its size, becoming as tall as a massive oak (Gargantuan) or as short as a blade of grass (Tiny). The change is entirely illusory, so the leshy's statistics do not change.
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage.
The library automaton chooses one creature it can see within 40 feet.

The charmed target regards the lorelei as its one, true love, to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the lorelei's control, it takes the lorelei's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can. Each time the lorelei or her companions cause the target to take damage, directly or indirectly, it repeats the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the lorelei is killed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.

All creatures within 20 feet of the mallqui must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (2d10) necrotic damage and gain a level of exhaustion. A creature becomes immune to the mallqui's xeric aura for the next 24 hours after making a successful save against it.
Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, range 30/90 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (3d6 + 3) necrotic damage.

Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 round. The poison duration is cumulative with multiple failed saving throws.
Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 poison damage. If the target is also poisoned by the mamura's claws, it takes another 1d6 poison damage at the start of each of its turns while the poisoning remains in effect.
The mask wight makes one Khopesh of Oblivion attack and one Enervating Spiked Gauntlet attack.
Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or some cherished material thing disappears from the universe, and only the target retains any memory of it. This item can be as large as a building, but it can't be a living entity and it can't be on the target's person or within the target's sight.
Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (2d12 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 11 (2d10) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion. The target recovers from all exhaustion caused by the enervating spiked gauntlet at the end of its next long rest.
The mask wight emits an ear-piercing wail. All creatures within 30 feet of the wight take 65 (10d12) thunder damage and are permanently deafened; a successful DC 17 Charisma saving throw reduces damage to half and limits the deafness to 1d4 hours. Targets slain by this attack are erased from the memories of every creature in the planes, all written or pictorial references to the target fade away, and its body is obliterated-the only exception is those who personally witnessed the death. Restoring such a slain creature requires a wish or divine intervention; no mortal remembers the creature's life or death.
The mavka makes two slam attacks.
Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 23 (4d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 11 (2d10) necrotic damage.
The mi-go makes two attacks with its claws.
Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) slashing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 13). If both claw attacks strike the same target in a single turn, the target takes an additional 13 (2d12) psychic damage.

The mindrot thrall makes two claw attacks.
Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage.
The thrall exhales a blast of acidic spores from its rotten lungs in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area takes 36 (8d8) acid damage, or half damage with a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the creature is also infected with mindrot spores.
Infection occurs when mindrot spores are inhaled or swallowed. Infected creatures must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the end of every long rest; nothing happens if the saving throw succeeds, but if it fails, the creature takes 9 (2d8) acid damage and its hit point maximum is reduced by the same amount. The infection ends when the character makes successful saving throws after two consecutive long rests, or receives the benefits of a lesser restoration spell or comparable magic. A creature slain by this disease becomes a mindrot thrall after 24 hours unless the corpse is destroyed.
The mirager makes two slam attacks.
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage.
The mirager feeds on the body moisture of creatures it lures into kissing it. A creature must be charmed, grappled, or incapacitated to be kissed. A kiss hits automatically, does 21 (6d6) necrotic damage, and fills the mirager with an exultant rush of euphoria that has the same effect as a heroism spell lasting 1 minute. The creature that was kissed doesn't notice that it took damage from the kiss unless it makes a successful DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check.
The mirager performs a sinuously swaying dance. Humanoids within 20 feet that view this dance must make a successful DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned for 1d4 rounds and charmed by the mirager for 1 minute. Humanoids of all races and genders have disadvantage on this saving throw. A creature that saves successfully is immune to this mirager's dance for the next 24 hours.

Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 30 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage plus 6 (1d12) poison damage and the target is poisoned until the start of the moss lurker's next turn. A successful DC 11 Constitution save halves the poison damage and prevents poisoning.
Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 100 ft. (vertically), one target. Hit: 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage.
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be affected by the Selket's venom curse (see above).
The myconid uses either its Deathcap Spores or its Slumber Spores, then makes a fist attack.
Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (4d4 + 1) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (4d4) poison damage.
The myconid ejects spores at one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 3 rounds. While poisoned this way, the target also takes 10 (4d4) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
The myconid ejects spores at one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned and unconscious for 1 minute. A creature wakes up if it takes damage, or if another creature uses its action to shake it awake.
The myling makes one bite and two claw attacks.
Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d4 + 2) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 12). If the target was grappled by the myling at the start of the myling's turn, the bite attack hits automatically.
Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d6 + 1) slashing damage.
If the myling starts its turn on its chosen burial ground, it sinks into the earth. If it has a creature grappled, that creature sinks with the myling. A Medium or larger creature sinks up to its waist; a Small creature sinks up to its neck. If the myling still has the victim grappled at the start of the myling's next turn, both of them disappear into the earth. While buried this way, a creature is considered stunned. It can free itself with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check, but only one check is allowed; if it fails, the creature is powerless to aid itself except with magic. The creature must also make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw; if it succeeds, the creature has a lungful of air and can hold its breath for (Constitution modifier + 1) minutes before suffocation begins. Otherwise, it begins suffocating immediately. Allies equipped with digging tools can reach it in four minutes divided by the number of diggers; someone using an improvised tool (a sword, a plate, bare hands) counts as only one-half of a digger.
The naina makes two claw attacks and one bite attack.
Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 24 (3d12 + 5) piercing damage.
Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 24 (3d12 + 5) slashing damage.
While in drake form (only), the naina breathes a 20-foot cone of poison gas, paralytic gas, or sleep gas.
A creature caught in this poison gas takes 18 (4d8) poison damage and is poisoned; a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw reduces damage to half and negates the poisoned condition. While poisoned this way, the creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failure, it takes 9 (2d8) poison damage and the poisoning continues; on a success, the poisoning ends.
A creature caught in this paralytic gas must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 2d4 rounds. A paralyzed creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns; a successful save ends the paralysis.
A creature caught in this sleeping gas must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 6 rounds. A sleeping creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns; it wakes up if it makes the save successfully.
The nichny makes two claw attacks.
Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d12 + 4) slashing damage.
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 27 (4d10 + 5) piercing damage, and a Medium or smaller target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be swallowed whole. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained and has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the nightgarm. It takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the nightgarm's turns. A nightgarm can have only one creature swallowed at a time. If the nightgarm takes 25 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the nightgarm must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone within 5 feet of the nightgarm. If the nightgarm dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.

Every creature that occupies the same space as the swarm must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become temporarily blinded as their eyes strain from their sockets. This blindness lasts for as long as the affected creature remains in the same space as the oculus; it ends at the end of the blinded creature's turn if the creature is out of the oculus's space. Also, any cure spell cast on the blinded creature ends the temporary blindness, but not restoration spells. If a creature that's already temporarily blinded is targeted again by eye extraction and fails the saving throw, that creature becomes permanently blind as its eyes are pulled from their sockets to join the swarm (causing 1d8 piercing damage). Success on either saving throw renders that creature immune to eye extraction for 24 hours (but it still doesn't recover its sight until it gets out of the swarm). An oculo swarm with 50 or fewer hit points can't use this ability.
The swarm targets every creature in its space with a gaze attack. The swarm can choose one of two effects for the attack: confusion or hold person. Every target in the swarm's space is affected unless it makes a successful DC 14 Charisma saving throw. Even creatures that avert their eyes or are blind can be affected by an oculus swarm's gaze. The confusion or hold person effect lasts 1d4 rounds.
The oozasis makes two pseudopod attacks.
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) acid damage, and a target that's Large or smaller is grappled (escape DC 16) and restrained until the grapple ends. The oozasis has two pseudopods, each of which can grapple one target at a time.
The oozasis engulfs creatures grappled by it. An engulfed creature can't breathe, is restrained, is no longer grappled, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the oozasis, takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the oozasis's turns, and is subject to the oozasis's Waters of Unfathomable Compulsion trait. The creature takes no damage if the oozasis chooses not to inflict any. When the oozasis moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. An engulfed creature can escape by using an action and making a successful DC 16 Strength check. On a success, the creature enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the oozasis.
The oozasis sublimates its waters into a vapor that fills a disk centered on the oozasis, 60 feet in radius, and 10 feet thick. All creatures in the area are affected by either the calm emotions spell or the confusion spell (save DC 16). The oozasis chooses which effect to use, and it must be the same for all creatures.
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) acid damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 13).
The ostinato makes two cacophony ray attacks.
Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (3d6) thunder damage.
One humanoid that the ostinato can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or the ostinato merges with it, becoming an enjoyable, repetitive tune in its host's mind. The ostinato can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect. The target retains control of its body and is aware of the ostinato's presence only as a melody, not as a living entity. The target no longer needs to eat or drink, gains the ostinato's Magic Resistance trait, and has advantage on Charisma checks. It also has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws and it can't maintain concentration on spells or other effects for more than a single turn. The target can make a DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check once every 24 hours; on a success, it realizes that the music it hears comes from an external entity. The Aural Symbiosis lasts until the target drops to 0 hit points, the ostinato ends it as a bonus action, or the ostinato is forced out by a dispel evil and good spell or comparable magic. When the Aural Symbiosis ends, the ostinato bursts forth in a thunderous explosion of sound and reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target. All creatures within 60 feet, including the original target, take 21 (6d6) thunder damage, or half damage with a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw. The target becomes immune to this ostinato's Aural Symbiosis for 24 hours if it succeeds on the saving throw or after the Aural Symbiosis ends.
While merged with a humanoid (see Aural Symbiosis), the ostinato feeds on nearby creatures. Up to nine creatures of the ostinato's choice within 60 feet of it can be targeted. Each target must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or take 3 (1d6) necrotic damage and have its hit point maximum reduced by the same amount until it finishes a long rest. The target dies if its maximum hit points are reduced to 0. Victims notice this damage immediately, but not its source.
The pombero uses Charming Touch if able, and makes two fist attacks.
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 13).
The pombero chooses a creature it can see within 5 feet. The creature must make a successful DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 10 minutes. The effect ends if the charmed creature takes damage. The pombero can have only one creature at a time charmed with this ability. If it charms a new creature, the previous charm effect ends immediately.
The pombero becomes invisible until it chooses to end the effect as a bonus action, or when it attacks.
The pillar makes two slam attacks.
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage.
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage.
A putrid haunt can vomit forth the contents of its stomach onto a target within 5 feet. Along with the bile and mud from its stomach, this includes 2d6 undead leeches that attach to the target. A creature takes 1 necrotic damage per leech on it at the start of the creature's turn, and the putrid haunt gains the same number of temporary hit points. As an action, a creature can remove or destroy 1d3 leeches from itself or an adjacent ally.
The qwyllion uses its deadly gaze if it can, and makes two claw attacks.
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 24 (3d12 + 5) slashing damage.
The qwyllion turns its gaze against a single creature within 20 feet of the qwyllion. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 16 (3d8 + 3) necrotic damage and be incapacitated until the start of the qwyllion's next turn. A humanoid slain by a qwyllion's death gaze rises 2d4 hours later as a specter under the qwyllion's control.
the qwyllion's innate casting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage, and a bitten creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be infected with a disease. A diseased creature gains one level of exhaustion immediately. When the creature finishes a long rest, it must repeat the saving throw. On a failure, the creature gains another level of exhaustion. On a success, the disease does not progress. The creature recovers from the disease if its saving throw succeeds after two consecutive long rests or if it receives a lesser restoration spell or comparable magic. The creature then recovers from one level of exhaustion after each long rest.
The rat king summons three swarms of rats. The swarms appear immediately within 60 feet of the rat king. They can appear in spaces occupied by other creatures. The swarms act as allies of the rat king. They remain for 1 hour or until the rat king dies.
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1 piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) psychic damage and the target must make a successful DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 1 round. While charmed in this way, the creature regards one randomly determined ally as a foe.
Up to six creatures within 30 feet that can hear the ratatosk must make DC 14 Charisma saving throws. On a failure, the creature is affected as if by a confusion spell for 1 minute.

The ravenala targets a creature within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled and restrained by the ravenala. While restrained, the creature is engulfed inside the ravenala's trunk. The ravenala can grapple one creature at a time; grappling doesn't prevent it from using other attacks against different targets. The restrained creature must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On a failure, the creature is compelled to sing a lament of all its various mistakes and misdeeds for as long as it remains restrained. Singing prevents uttering command words, casting spells with a verbal component, or any verbal communication. The restrained creature can still make melee attacks. When the ravenala moves, the restrained creature moves with it. A restrained creature can escape by using an action to make a DC 15 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the ravenala.

The redcap makes two pike attacks and one bite attack.
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage and the creature is bleeding profusely. A bleeding creature must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the start of its turn or take 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and continue bleeding. On a successful save the creature takes no necrotic damage and the effect ends. A creature takes only 10 necrotic damage per turn from this effect no matter how many times it's been bitten, and a single successful saving throw ends all bleeding. Spending an action to make a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check or any amount of magical healing also stops the bleeding. Constructs and undead are immune to the bleeding effect.

Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1 piercing damage, and the suturefly sews the target's mouth, nose, or eye closed. With supernatural speed, the suturefly repeatedly pierces the target's face, each time threading a loop of the target's own skin through the previous hole. These skin loops rapidly blacken, shrink, and draw the orifice tightly closed. It takes two actions and a sharp blade to sever the loops and reopen the orifice, and the process causes intense pain and 2 slashing damage. A victim whose mouth and nose have been sewn shut begins suffocating at the start of his or her next turn.
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. Hit: 21 (6d6) fire damage, or 10 (3d6) fire damage if the swarm has half or fewer hit points.
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. Hit: 14 (4d6) piercing damage, or 7 (2d6) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or one randomly determined magic item in its possession is immediately affected by the Mana Erosion trait. A spellcaster hit by this attack must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or one of its lowest-level, unused spell slots is expended.
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. Hit: 10 (4d4) piercing damage, or 5 (2d4) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer. The target also takes 10 (4d4) poison damage and becomes euphoric for 1d4 rounds, or takes half as much poison damage and is not euphoric if it makes a successful DC 11 Constitution saving throw. A euphoric creature has disadvantage on saving throws.
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. Hit: 28 (8d6) cold damage or 14 (4d6) cold damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.

An affected creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a successful save. The effect can also be ended with a greater restoration spell or comparable magic.
A wolf spirit swarm uses icy doom, if it's available, and makes 3 bite attacks.
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) cold damage. The target is also knocked prone if the attack scored a critical hit.

As a bonus action on its first turn of combat, the wolf spirit swarm howls, emitting an unnatural and eerie cacophony that chills the blood. All creatures within 300 feet that hear the howl must make a successful DC 12 Charisma saving throw or be frightened until the start of the swarm's next turn.
Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (3d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 9 (2d4 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 14). The target must also make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.
Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and pushed 5 feet. The temple dog can immediately enter the position the target was pushed out of, if it chooses to.
The thuellai makes two claw attacks.
Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) slashing damage plus 26 (4d12) cold damage. If the target is wearing metal armor, it must make a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion.
The thuellai exhales an icy blast in a 40-foot cone. Each target in the area takes 39 (6d12) cold damage, or half damage with a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw.
All creatures within 10 feet of a thuellai take 7 (2d6) cold damage at the beginning of the thuellai's turn. Spells or magical effects that protect against cold are affected as if by a dispel magic spell (the theullai's effective spellcasting bonus is +5) if a thuellai is within 20 feet of the target at the start of the theullai's turn, and nonmagical flames within 20 feet of the thuellai are extinguished at the start of its turn.
a thuellai's howl can cause creatures to temporarily lose their minds and even to attack themselves or their companions. Each target within 100 feet of the theullai and able to hear the howl must make a successful DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or roll 1d8 and consult the table below at the start of its next turn. An affected creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns; a success ends the effect on itself, but a failure means it must roll again on the table below at the start of its next turn.

1 - Act normally

2-4 - Do nothing but babble incoherently

5-6 - Do 1d8 damage + Str modifier to self with item in hand

7-8 - Attack nearest target; select randomly if more than one
The thuellai creates an icy blizzard in the area around it. A 50-foot radius sphere surrounding the theullai fills with icy fog, whirling snow, and driving ice crystals. Vision is lightly obscured, and creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on vision or hearing. The ground in the affected area becomes difficult terrain. The effect lasts for 10 minutes and moves with the theullai.

The ancient titan opens a momentary rupture in the eldritch source that fuels its words of power. This rupture appears at a spot designated by the titan within 100 feet. Any creature within 60 feet of the spot must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 28 (8d6) force damage, falls prone, and is pulled 1d6 x 10 feet toward the eldritch singularity, taking an additional 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage per 10 feet they were dragged. If the saving throw succeeds, the target takes half as much force damage and isn't knocked prone or pulled. The spot where the rupture occurs becomes the center of a 60-foot-radius antimagic field until the end of the ancient titan's next turn. The titan's spells are not affected by this antimagic field.

The degenerate titan slams his fists onto the ground, creating a shockwave in a line 60 feet long and 10 feet wide. Each creature in the line takes 35 (10d6) force damage and is flung up 20 feet away from the titan and knocked prone; a successful DC 18 Dexterity saving throw halves the damage and prevents the creature from being flung or knocked prone. A creature that's flung against an unyielding object such as a wall or floor takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If it collides with another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage (1d6 bludgeoning per 10 feet) and be knocked prone.
The degenerate titan utters a scream that rends reality in a 30-foot cone. Any ongoing spell or magical effect of 3rd level or lower in the area ends. For every spell or effect of 4th level or higher in the area, the degenerate titan makes a Constitution check against DC (10 + the level of the spell or effect). On a success, the spell or effect ends.

If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the titanoboa. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the snake, and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the titanoboa's turns. If the titanoboa takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the titanoboa must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the titanoboa. If the titanoboa dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone.
Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 27 (3d12 + 8) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the titanoboa can't constrict another target.

A blinded creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
The hive-queen implants an egg into an incapacitated creature within 5 feet of her that is neither undead nor a construct. Until the egg hatches or is removed, the creature is poisoned, paralyzed, and does not need to eat or drink. The egg hatches in 1d6 weeks, and the larval tosculi kills the host creature.

The treacle assumes the shape of any tiny creature or object. A reshaped treacle gains the movement of its new form but no other special qualities.
A treacle touching the skin of a warm-blooded creature inflicts 4 (1d8) necrotic damage per hour of contact, and the victim's maximum hit points are reduced by the same number. Blood is drained so slowly that the victim doesn't notice the damage unless he or she breaks contact with the treacle (sets it down or hands it to someone else, for example).

The target's fate can be restored by a dispel evil and good spell or comparable magic.
The xhkarsh targets one creature within 5 feet of it whose fate has been corrupted. The target creature must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or a portion of the xhkarsh's consciousness inhabits its body. The target retains control of its body, but the xhkarsh can control its actions for 1 minute each day and can modify its memories as a bonus action (as if using the modify memory spell, DC 15). The target is unaware of the xhkarsh's presence, but can make a DC 18 Wisdom (Insight) check once every 24 hours to notice the presence of the xhkarsh. This effect lasts until the xhkarsh ends it or the target's fate is restored by a dispel evil and good spell or comparable magic. A creature becomes immune to this effect for 24 hours when it succeeds on the saving throw to resist the effect or after the effect ends on it for any reason. A single xhkarsh can seize up to four strands at the same time.

The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons:
Radiant Breath. The dragon exhales radiant energy in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 77 (14d10) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The mandriano drains the essence of one grappled target. The target must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The target's hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the mandriano regains hp equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way rises 24 hours later as a zombie or skeleton under the mandriano's control, unless the humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed. The mandriano can control up to twelve undead at one time.

It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the ankou's choice). Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form and it doesn't gain any class features or legendary actions of the new form.
The ankou can transport itself and up to eight creatures in contact with it to another plane of existence. This works like the plane shift spell, except dead or incorporeal creatures can be transported and don't have to be willing. The ankou can't use this ability to banish an unwilling creature.

It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. 

The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hp, the pishacha ends it as a bonus action, or the pishacha is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell.

The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the heggarna could appear to have fur, but someone touching it would feel its slippery flesh.

The lily must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to maintain the illusion. The illusion ends if the lily is incapacitated.

While charmed by the lily, a target is incapacitated and ignores the banquets of other lilies. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the lily’s banquet, the target must move on its turn toward the banquet by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn’t avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the lily, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it. A target that successfully saves is immune to this swamp lily’s Fake Feast for the next 24 hours.

If the charmed target starts its turn within 5 feet of the banquet, it eats the feast and must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 21 (6d6) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn’t poisoned.

At the start of each of the bubble’s turns, the target takes 9 (2d8) poison damage and begins suffocating as it breathes in the poisonous gases within the bubble. A creature is affected even if it holds its breath, but creatures that don’t need to breathe aren’t affected.

The bubble can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. It does so if its target falls unconscious or dies. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the bubble by succeeding on a DC 13 Strength check.

The timingila swims up to its swimming speed without provoking opportunity attacks. If it breaches the water’s surface, it crashes back down, creating a wave in a 30-foot-wide, 120-footlong line that is 30 feet tall. Any Gargantuan or smaller vehicles in the line are carried up to 100 feet away from the timingila and have a 50 percent chance of capsizing.
The timingila roars in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 45 (10d8) thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute.

If it hits, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or its soul is forced out of its body, appearing 20 feet in a random direction away from its body, for 1 minute. The creature has control of its soul, which is invisible and can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but it can’t cast spells or take any actions. The creature’s body is knocked unconscious and can’t be awoken until its soul returns, but it can take damage as normal. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, reoccupying its body on a success. Alternatively, a creature can reoccupy its body early if it starts its turn within 5 feet of its body. If a creature doesn’t return to its body within 1 minute, the creature dies.

The ulnorya separates itself into two identical copies for up to 1 hour. The new ulnoryas’ hp totals are equal to the original ulnorya’s hp total divided by 2 (rounded down), and each is affected by any conditions, spells, and other magical effects that affected the original ulnorya. The new ulnoryas otherwise retain the same statistics as the original, except neither has this action. The new ulnoryas act on the same initiative count as the original ulnorya and occupy any unoccupied spaces within 5 feet of the original ulnorya’s space.

If one ulnorya starts its turn within 5 feet of its other half, they can each use their reactions to recombine. The recombined ulnorya’s hp total is equal to the combined hp total of the two ulnoryas, and it is affected by any conditions, spells, and other magical effects currently affecting either of the combining ulnoryas. The ulnorya automatically recombines if both of its halves are still alive at the end of the hour. If only one ulnorya remains alive at the end of the hour, it gains this action after it finishes a long rest.

The vallowex can have only one creature swallowed at a time. If the vallowex takes 15 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the vallowex must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 5 feet of the vallowex. If the vallowex dies, the swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.
A vallowex can release a 40-foot-radius cloud of microscopic eggs into a body of water it touches. The eggs live for 1 hour. Any humanoid or beast that drinks the eggs must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be infected with a disease—a vallowex tadpole. A host can carry only one vallowex tadpole to term at a time. While diseased, the host must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of each long rest. On a failed save, the host’s Strength score is reduced by 1d4. This reduction lasts until the host finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. If the host’s Strength score is reduced to 0, the host dies, and a vallowex emerges from the corpse.

A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, and it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the viiret. At the start of each of the viiret’s turns, the creature takes 7 (2d6) acid damage. If the creature is poisoned or suffering from a disease, it takes 3 (1d6) necrotic damage at the start of each of the viiret’s turns instead. In addition, at the start of each of the viiret’s turns, a swallowed creature that is poisoned or suffering from a disease can repeat the condition or disease’s saving throw as if it had taken a long rest, but it suffers no ill effects on a failed saving throw.
